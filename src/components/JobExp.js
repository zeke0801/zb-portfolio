                A first of its kind in the local scene, a veterinarion-focused application that gives Mobile Veterinarians the ability to issue
                ping warnings to their customers that they are inbound or within the area of their current or next routine check-up giving the clients
                chance to inform the veterinarian of their upcoming or due checkups for their pets while saving mobile vets time and gas-money especially 
                for clients who live in far flung places.
