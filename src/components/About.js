          <p>A proud graduate of Ateneo de Naga University, 
          I hold a Bachelor of Science in <span>Computer Science</span> with a 
          specialization in <span>app prototyping, Figma design, 
          and project and workflow management</span>. Throughout my academic 
          journey, I focused on mastering the art of creating 
          innovative applications and refining processes to achieve 
          greater efficiency and effectiveness. My strong technical 
          background is complemented by a robust understanding of 
          project management principles and best practices. 
          I have a proven track record of leading projects, <span>such as being a co-founder
          of a local tech startup</span> and 
          collaborating with diverse teams to drive high-quality 
          results and deliver impactful solutions. 
          My hands-on experience in both the technical and 
          managerial aspects of development equips me with a 
          unique perspective, allowing me to bridge gaps between 
          complex technical requirements and practical, 
          user-friendly applications.</p>
